## Node.js Setup

To complete the Node.js exercises, you'll need:

1. Node.js installed on your computer (download from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/))
2. A text editor (VS Code recommended)
3. Basic familiarity with using the command line/terminal

### Getting Started with Node.js Exercises

1. Open your terminal/command prompt
2. Navigate to the exercise directory: `cd /path/to/exercises`
3. Run the exercise: `node node-oppgave1.js`
4. Follow the comments and instructions within each file

## Getting Started

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine
2. Open the HTML files in your web browser
3. Follow the instructions in each exercise
4. Use the browser's Developer Tools (F12) to see console output and debug

## Learning Path

This course is structured to introduce:

1. Basic JavaScript syntax and concepts
